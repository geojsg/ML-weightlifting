## Data Loading (training & test)

```{r data_loading}
pmltrain<-read.csv("pml-training.csv",header=T)
pmltest<-read.csv("pml-testing.csv",header=T)

## dimension of the training set
dim(pmltrain)

```

## Exploration



## Pre-processing

First, we will remove all features having mostling blank or NA value

```{r preproc1}
NAcol<-sapply(pmltrain,function(x) (sum(is.na(x)|x=="")/nrow(pmltrain))>0.95)
pmlc<-pmltrain[,!NAcol]
dim(pmlc)

```

## Removing features having more than 95% of NA values
NAcol<-sapply(pml,function(x) (sum(is.na(x)|x=="")/nrow(pml))>0.95)
pmlc<-pml[,!NAcol]

## Removing non-relevant features such as user names and timestamp according to the context
pmlc<-pmlc[,-c(1:7)]

```{r partition, warning=FALSE }
library(caret)
inTrain<-createDataPartition(y=pmlc$classe, p=0.7,list=FALSE)
training<-pmlc[inTrain,]
testing<-pmlc[-inTrain,]
```
